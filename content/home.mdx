## Art & Photography

I started doing photography in college just because I loved color grading photos,
I extended that creative energy to digital art and learned blender.
While I mostly made things for myself and my friends, I had the opportunity
to collaborate with The Perfect Sign Language Pistol, a swedish band, I made the [cover art for their debut EP](https://open.spotify.com/album/2ijOSpTEni8IxbZgWJIt5K).
You can [view my art here](/art).
